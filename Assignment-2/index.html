                    Addie LaRue is a girl born in 1714 in a little French town that is not the place for her aspirations. The imminent betrothal to a suitor chosen by her parents only makes her desires for liberation stronger. With a mix of desperation and boldness, she invokes a dark deity after dusk—a blunder that is, by all means, a big no-no. The deity complies with her wish: she shall be free, unshackled, and shall live for eternally.
                    However, along with the gift goes a curse—she shall be no one's after the moment she disappears from sight.
                    This chapter is the one that creates the emotional atmosphere and marks the start of Addie’s 300-year-long journey.

                    Immortal and isolated now, Addie gets a painful introduction to the terrifying rules that come with her new existence.
                    People forget about her in a matter of seconds.
                    She is not allowed to have a place, a job or even someone who knows her by her name.
                    Even inanimate things elude her unless she pilfers them.
                    The chapter recounts the protagonist's early days of stumbling, starving and being invisible in each interaction. It reflects the sorrow of being overlooked—and the resolution that is always there to help her go on.

                     Time seems to elongate. Addie goes on a tour to Europe, getting used to a world that will never know her but will always be her endless fascination.
                      She remains a quiet muse to various creative minds, giving birth to pictures, sounds, and novels she will never be able to attribute to her name.
                      The storyteller delves into her tenacity, smart survival tactics, and the life-giving agony of healing for centuries without ever being completely accepted.
                      This chapter enriches her character and demonstrates how she gradually learns to coexist with her curse by not resisting it anymore.
